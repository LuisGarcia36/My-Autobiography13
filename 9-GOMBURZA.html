<p style="text-indent: 65px;">I am Luis Justine Lee M. Garcia, born on August 26, 2010. I was blessed to be born into a loving family. My parents are Louie Garcia and Hernani Miranda. My father, a seaman taught me the importance of a good communication while my mother prioritizes our health. I am grateful for my sister Sophia Bianca Matito, who have been my partner in adventure and growth. Growing up in Tondo Manila, I was blessed with a close-knit family that nurtured my dreams. My parents' guidance and my sibling camaraderie helped me develop resilience and empathy. Our family's legacy of good values and traditions continues to inspire me. As I navigate life's journey, I draw strength from my family's love and lessons, grateful for the foundation they've provided.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">One of my fondest childhood memories is spending sun-kissed days swimming at our local pool. I recall the thrill of learning to swim. Endless hours of pool games with sibling and friends. Every summer of Holy week are interwined with joy and devotion." Mahal na Araw" parades were a highlight of my childhood. I joined the procession and costumed as one of disciples. The solemnity of the occasion remain precious of tradition in community. Growing up in the vibrant streets of Tondo, Manila. My childhood was a kaleidoscope of colors, sounds, and flavors. I remember playing hide-and-seek among the jeepneys and tricycles in our narrow alleyway. Those carefree days in Tondo shaped my resilience, resourcefulness, and love for the simple joys in life. The aroma of freshly baked pandesal from the nearby bakery. Our small home was filled with laughter, music, and stories from my parents and grandparents.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 75px;">My weekend were often filled with excitement and wonder courtesy of my parents love for exploration. We visited Baguio City, where we marveled at the majestic Burnham Park, Mines View Park and Lion's Head. In Pangasinan we paid respect at the historic Manoag Church, admiring its grandeur. Our family also visited "Kamay ni Hesus"  in Quezon Province.I vividly remember Saturday afternoon's spent at the cinema. Sunday mornings were a cherished tradition in our household. We'd attend church together, singing hymns and listening to sermons that instilled values of compassion and kindness. Our church family became like a second family, providing love, support, and guidance. Those moments shaped my faith, fostered meaningful relationships, and created lifelong memories.Sunday's were also  reserved for visits to the zoo, Afterwards we strolled at the mall. My family loves eating outside for especial occasion or have a Boodle fight at home.</p>
